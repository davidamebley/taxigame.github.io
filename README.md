This is a dynamic, interactive web game developed using vanilla JavaScript, primarily utilizing HTML canvases, animations, and CSS. This game was created as part of a capstone project during a Visual Web Development course in my Master's program. It showcases advanced programming skills and a deep understanding of web-based game development.
